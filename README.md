# HPC Internships
Supercomputing @ GT club has compiled a list of organizations that offer internships and experiences in HPC and applications of HPC. This is a working list, so check back to see if we've (or you've) found any new internships.

Most are available this season, though there are exceptions for record purposes. The goal of this list is to ensure someone who wants to intern in the HPC space is aware of what's out there, so links may expire as time passes. This list was made for 2023, but these orgs are likely to provide internships of this nature year after year.

The original document we compiled can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXSyCtucD6YsH7eFSETqrgGM-VmSRE0ZeBmmocr-9r0/edit?usp=sharing). Further details about deadlines can also be found here.

Acronyms
- LPR - Legal Permanant Resident

If you find any other internships from outside the sheet, feel free to make a pull request or let us know at supercomputing.gt@gmail.com

Inspired by the Pitt CSC's list of internships.
